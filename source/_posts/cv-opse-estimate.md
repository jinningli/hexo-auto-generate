  - Town-down method
  - recall 99%

- STN: spartial transform network
  - $\theta$ automatic parameter for bounding box
  - $\theta^{-1}$ reverse transformation
  - Symmetric STN: this network can be lazy. to avoid STN not transform the pose to the center, parallel SPPE
  - distribution error differ by the detection tools: fastRCNN, SSD, etc.
  - RMPE CMUpose

- 3D pose
