# ABSTRACT
Drawing a beautiful painting is a dream of many people since childhood. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme LINE ARTIST to synthesize artistic style paintings with free- hand sketch images, leveraging the power of deep learning and advanced algorithm.

Our scheme includes three models. The Sketch Image Extraction (SIE) model is applied to generate the train- ing data. It includes smoothing reality images and pen- cil sketch extraction. The Detailed Image Synthesis (DIS) model trains a conditional adversarial net to generate re- ality detailed information. The Adaptively Weighted Artis- tic Style Transfer (AWAST) model is capable to combine multiple style image with content via VGG19 network and PageRank algorithm. The appealing stylized images are then generated by optimization iterations.

Experiments are operated on the Kaggle Cats dataset and The Oxford Buildings Dataset. Our synthesis results are artistic, beautiful and steadier. Real sketch tests prove that our scheme performs very well on reality environments. With different artist styles, our scheme can generate paintings of various styles. With our scheme, everyone can draw a beautiful picture only by drawing a sketch and then feed- ing it into our system.
